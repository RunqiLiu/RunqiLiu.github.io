            <h2 class="major">What is Washi Tape?</h2>

            <p>'Washi' is a type of traditional Japanese paper that is made using fibers of plants,
                and the craft of manually making this paper has been classified as a
                UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Despite that current washi tapes
                are made in factory assembly line, the name 'washi' is kept due to
                its special texture. </p>
            <p>The two main differences between washi
                and normal tapes are its stickiness and colorful nature:
                once put onto a piece of paper, it can be peeled
                off without leaving any trace on the paper, and it can have
                colorful pictures and patterns.</p>

            <p> It can be used in for different purposes: journal decoration,
                wall decoration, furniture decoration, door decoration...... Creativity
                is the key, as washi tapes can be used on anything, in any place, at any time. </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: right">-Of Washi tape sellers and buyers</h3>
            <h3>Data Background:</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center">
                1000 Taobao stores' locations <br>
                160,000 Douban users' locations <br>
                geographical distributions displayed using Baidu Map API
            </p>
            <p>The comparison between sellers and buyers distribution can be valuable in facilitating sellers to choose which offline washi market in which geographical area to participate.
                Customer distribution gives guidance to the potential revenue, and seller distribution provides indicators to the
                level of competition in a specific geographic area.</p>
            <p> <i>(Hover your mouse over purple dots below to see their city and quantity labels.)</i></p>
            </p>
            <p  class="insert_object">
                <object  type="text/html" data="docs/location_viz.html" ></object>
            </p>
            <p>
                Shanghai has the greatest number (218) of online washi tape sellers, being 22% of the total number. Its quantity is almost twice when comparing Beijing,
                which has 117, the second most amount of online washi tape shops.
            </p>
            <p>
                When viewing the map above, it can be seen that most of the online shops are
                concentrated in east China, with few being located in west and north China.
                This corresponds to a research conducted by Alibaba in 2016 regarding
                ‘E-commerce Service Competitiveness’(1) in China, in which it concluded that
                6 out of the 10 highest scoring provinces are located in Eastern China.
            </p>
            <p  class="insert_object" style="height: 500px">
                <object  type="text/html" data="docs/customer_viz.html" ></object>
            </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <p>In the customer distribution map above, it can be noticed that Beijing (22353), rather than Shanghai (18052), has the greatest number of customers, and there is a 20% difference between these two locations.
                Moreover, the distribution of consumers is more evenly spread across the nation than sellers.</p>
            <p>
                Hence, it can be inferred from the two maps below that for sellers,
                applying offline markets in Shanghai would be the most diffluent to be selected on account of substantial competition,
                while attending fairs in Beijing has a higher potential of earning higher revenue due to less intense competition
                with more sufficient consumers.

                total monthly sales revenue of 10.5 million RMB <br>
                from a sales volume of 1 million items

            -data from 25 most prominent and successful Taobao washi tape shops</p>
            <p>
                Two points can be highlighted after reviewing these numbers:<br>
                1. In the washi tape market, <b><i>quantity</i></b> is paramount to revenue gaining.
                There are 50k+ items, meaning each one's total sales is less than 200 RMB. <br>
                2. The market is dominated by <b><i>low price</i></b> items.
                Dividing monthly revenue by the total quantity of items sold,
                each item's price is solely around 10RMB.
            </p>
            <p> <i>(Hover your mouse over colored sections below to see their labels in the center of the pie chart.)</i></p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt=""/></span>

                These items cannot be allocated to a specific brand.

                    *grey sections: individually smaller than 1% of the total revenue (100k) or 1% of the total sales volume (1000 items)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Items made in mainland China has both the highest revenue and the highest sales volume,
                all around 75%. Within this sector, one brand stands out the most on account of its immense
                difference between its sales volume and revenue market share percentage: 故宫 (the forbidden
                city). With less than 6% of the market's sales volume share, its revenue market share is
                as high as 22.66%. Browing its website, I believe its success can be accounted to the
                uniqueness and originality of its items. Ideas inspired by items used in ancient China,
                it firmly grabs Chinese customer's shopping psychology of being fond of objects from ancient
                times, especially those related to the royal family.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other aspect worthing noticing from these pie charts is that despite
                Japanese made washi tapes only take up 6.67% of the market according to
                sales volume, its revenue market share, in fact, doubles its sales volume
                market share, being 13.22%. This underscores the fact that washi tape
                brands originated from Japan usually sells at a higher price when compared
                with local Chinese brands. Customer continues to buy Japanese washi tape
                despite higher price mainly because of better quality, especially better stickiness.

            </p>

            <p>
                From the collected data, it can be seen that the most common category of
                the item sold accompanying washi tape is stickers, 1346 (67.3%) out 2000 have it.
                It can be inferred that the high quantity is due to product similarity between
                washi tapes and stickers. Washi tape customers have a high potential of
                also being sticker consumers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from stickers, washi tape shops are, at the same time,
                closely linked with stationeries' selling. Various types of notebooks,
                pens, and other stationery accessories are also popular among sellers.
                Washi tapes are usually used in journal decorations, the indispensability
                of these items in this process enables them to become common items
                sold alongside washi tapes.

            <h2 class="major">Future: Opportunities</h2>
            <p> Initiated in the recent decade, the washi tape market is still in its fast-growing period.
                With the market not reaching saturation, new brands and stores,
                which are sprouting on a daily basis, have substantial opportunity to seize
                the market share and become one of the leading brands. Yet because of
                the existence of a vast number of small sellers, new brands and stores
                can also lose their ways easily and unconsciously.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to this data analysis research, there are several aspects of the
                market that special attention should be paid and opportunities may lay:
            </p>
            <i>
            <p>
                1. Create Origin Items <br>
                With unoriginal items, others can always wholesale the same item and
                compete with one another over price, which usually leads to a vicious
                cycle of the price war. Yet, as demonstrated by brands such as 故宫(the
                Forbidden City), on account of its uniqueness, it securely seizes a large
                percentage of the revenue market share.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Attend Offline Washi Tape Markets in Cities Such As Beijing, Chengdu, and Wuhan <br>
                Most of the online washi tape sellers are located in east China while customer
                distribution does not follow the same pattern, suggesting that for smaller or
                immature shops, offline markets' competition will be much more intense in east China
                than anywhere else in the country.<br>
                However, in these three cities listed above, there are a much greater number
                of consumers when compared with shops. In places where demand is greater than
                supply, the opportunity becomes available and there is a higher possibility of
                gaining more revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Do Not Let Washi Tape Be The Only Type Of Item In The Shop<br>
                For items with a low price per unit, consumers value one-stop shopping
                more than ever. They would like to find everything they want in one shop,
                mostly due to the sentiment to pay the postage only once. As analyzed,
                stationeries and stickers are the two most popular combination for washi
                tape selling. Having them available in the shop will most likely make a
                shop more attractive and competitive than those which do not have.
